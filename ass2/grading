Q1: 25/30
M is actually increased by ceil(h[i-1]/h[i]) - 1 instead of floor(h[i-1]/h[I]), 
to see this, consider the case when h[i-1] = 10 and h[i] = 2 while I won't penalise this.

The general logic to maximise the leftmost stack while minimising the number of splits is correct, 
however, we have explicitly stated that the standard of proof is much higher in this assignment and the brief explanation 
in the response does not really prove that the solution is optimal. Why maximising the leftmost stack gives the optimal solution and 
why splitting into more than ceil(H(i)/l) stacks is not optimal should be proved more formally and can be proved via contradiction/induction

2.1 ) Well done!

2.2) Nice job recognizing that an additional proof was required to generalize 2.1 ðŸ¥³ 
However, your induction proof does not follow. You state that S_{2n - 2} \geq S'_{2n - 2} which is not true. Consider L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], L' = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1],

S_{2n - 2} = 1*2 + 3*4 = 14
S'_{2n -2} = 6 * 5 + 4 * 3 = 42.

You were very close with this solution but require a different set of logic to complete the inductive proof. Refer to the sample answers for an example of a valid inductive proof.

2.3 ) Identical issues to 2.2
