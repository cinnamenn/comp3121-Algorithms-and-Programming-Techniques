Q1: 24/30
You need to clearly justify why the solution of x should exist within 1 ... log(V). It is not a known fact for this problem.

Review Feedback:

Please read the marker's feedback to understand why your marks are deduct from question 1.2. 
We don't know that the lower bound is 1 and upper bound is log(V). 
So, you need to clearly justify why the solution of x should exist within 1 ... log(V).

Don't forget to prove your algorithm works. We weight correctness justification highly in this course, 
and it is expected that you not only provide a solution, but prove that it works. 
For example, explain why m - i + 1 is added to the inversion count - what does this represent?

You need to explain how you find B_index, and justify its complexity.

4.1 this is only half answered, you state how to do the preprocess, but from that preprocessing you don't state how to calculate the number of red flowers in a given subarray (-3)

4.2 you seem to have misread the question. we wanted red flowers inside > yellow flowers OUTSIDE, you seem to be trying to solve for both inside.

this was a pretty good approach to that problem though, so well done there

===================

Review request response:

your review request states that it is not stated in the question. 
I direct your attention to the question, which is included as part of your submission. 
"Question 4 Red & Yellow Flowers [20 marks] You are given an array of n flowers that are either red or yellow. 
Your goal is to find the number of subarrays where there are more red flowers contained within the subarray, 
than there are yellow flowers outside the subarray"

4.2 then instructs you to find an algorithm to achieve your goal. 
Which, as quoted above, it to find the number of subarrays where there are more red flowers contained within the subarray, 
than there are yellow flowers outside the subarray.
This was very clearly laid out. I'm sorry you did not understand that, 
but before submitting a remark request rereading the question would have been wise. 
I dont know what to do other than quote the question to you.   Previous mark stands
